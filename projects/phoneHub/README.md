# PhoneHub (NSFW)
-- this project is a simple Phub inspiration for phones. Some of those include the use of the real phub website and some were created directly by me, like the banner and such. This project is intended with the sole purpose to use my skiils throughout my class #COMP SCI 201. Introduction to Computing & Internet Technologies at UWGB.
